@CollectionOfElements
	public Map<String, String> getProperties() {
		return this.properties;
	}

in hibernate we have by default fetchtype - lazy=true

output will be

org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: SupportProperty.properties, no session or session was closed.

this is because

	after the session is closed,

we are saying

		System.out.println(p1.get("score")); 
			System.out.println(p1.get("grade"));
