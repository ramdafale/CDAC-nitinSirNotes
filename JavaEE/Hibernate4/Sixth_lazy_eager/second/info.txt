@CollectionOfElements(fetch=FetchType.EAGER)
	public Map<String, String> getProperties() {
		return this.properties;
	}

we are setting fetch=FetchType.EAGER, that means when parent is loaded, all childrens are also loaded.


output will be

50
A
it is all over


u won't get any exception 

this is because

	inside "SupportProperty.hbm.xml"
we have specified

	 default-lazy="false"
this leads to eager loading and hence, even if the session is closed,

we can say

		System.out.println(p1.get("score")); 
			System.out.println(p1.get("grade"));
