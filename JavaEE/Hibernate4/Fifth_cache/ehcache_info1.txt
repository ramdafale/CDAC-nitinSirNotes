<defaultCache> attribute specifies the values to user for objects without a specific cache defined.In this example,by default only 1000 objects are stored in the memory. After that they are spooled to disk. If a cache is marked as eternal (true), then the object never expires. Otherwise timeToIdlSeconds specifies how long an object can be idle before it expires. The timeToLiveSeconds value specifies the overall length of time that an object can be cached before being expired.
