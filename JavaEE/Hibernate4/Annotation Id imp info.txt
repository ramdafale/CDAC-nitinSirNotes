	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
	@Column(name = "id", nullable = false)
	public int getId() {
		return this.id;
	}


@Id attribute must be there on getter method and not on setter method.
if u give it on setter method u get exception.

@Id can be either with "getter" method or with variable declaration.

other attributes e.g. @Columns can have on either getter or setter methods.
