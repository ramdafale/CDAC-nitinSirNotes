The main contract here is the creation of Session instances. Usually an application has a single SessionFactory instance and threads servicing client requests obtain Session instances from this factory.

The internal state of a SessionFactory is immutable. Once it is created this internal state is set. This internal state includes all of the metadata about Object/Relational Mapping.

Implementors must be threadsafe.
