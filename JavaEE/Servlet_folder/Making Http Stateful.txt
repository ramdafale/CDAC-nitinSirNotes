Http is a stateless protocol.
client requests a web resource (servlet/jsp).

when client requests a web resource again or to another web resource, for container it is a different client altogether.
i.e. container does not remember client after the response is given to client back.

in a practical scenario mostly we have a requirement where container should remember client. e.g. shopping cart example. i.e. we have a requirement of making Http stateful.

in java we can achieve it using:

a)hidden fields
b)custom cookies
c)HttpSession
d)URLRewriting
