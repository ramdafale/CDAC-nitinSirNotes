1) container loads the tag handler class, when it is used for the first time
2) it is instantiated with public no-arg constructor
	note:- tag handlers are never reused. Each tag handler instance takes care of single invocation. tag handler object will always be initialized before any of its methods are called.
3) container calls "setJspContext(JspContext)" method
JspContext is a parent of PageContext
4) if the tag is nested (invoked from within another tag), container calls "setParent(JspTag)" method.
5) if the tag has attributes, call attribute setters.
attribute setters are the setter methods which you define in your tag handler class for each attribute.
6) if the tag is not declared to have a <body-content> of empty, and the tag has a body, call the "setJspBody(JspFragment)" method.
	if the tag has a body, body comes in through this method, as an instance of JspFragment.
7) container calls "doTag()" , which you have overridden.
