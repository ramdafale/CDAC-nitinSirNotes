<body-content>scriptless</body-content>
	it means tag can have a body, but the body cannot have scripting (declaration,expression,scriptlets)


getJspBody() is a method of SimpleTagSupport

it returns JspFragment

	a JspFragment is an object that represents JSP code. The body of a tag that invokes a simple tag handler is encapsulated in the JspFragment object, then sent to the tag handler in the setJspBody() method.
The imp. thing about JspFragment is that it should not contain any scripting elements (declarations,expressions,scriptlets etc.). It can contain template text,standard and custom actions, and EL expressions.
