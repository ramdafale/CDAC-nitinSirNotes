<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>

here by default scope is "compile". u don't need it during runtime, because Web Container provides those classes.



 <dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId> 
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.17</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency> 

it is very imp to note that scope for "mysql-connector-java" is "runtime". if it is "compile" or "provided", it does not work. The reason being u can't expect Web container to provide this library automatically during runtime, u have to ensure that the library is available during runtime by specifying :

<scope>runtime</scope>
