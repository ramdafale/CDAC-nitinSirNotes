go to "d:\mvn\javaapp>"

and say

mvn install

on successful completion of this command go and check inside

C:\Users\admin\.m2\repository    folder

u will get

com
	tigers
		javaapp
			1.0-SNAPSHOT
				javaapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

that is ur jar file "javaapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" is created in local repository.
This also means that now u can use it in some other java application with the help of "pom.xml".

now go to eclipse

file
new
	java project

core1

new class
MyApp



package core1;

public class MyApp
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		System.out.println("invoking App java");
		App a1=new App();
	}

}



now u will get error for "App"

right click on project
configure

convert to maven project

inside generated pom.xml file

after

</build>  tag

add

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
  <groupId>com.tigers</groupId>
  <artifactId>javaapp</artifactId>
  <packaging>jar</packaging>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
  </dependencies>

refresh the project

now once again go to the statement "App a=new App()"


u will get a suggestion "import com.tigers"
click on that.

Thats it....... so this is the way u can use App.java through local repository.
