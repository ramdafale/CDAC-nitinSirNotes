Auto Scanning

	<context:component-scan>
		it informs Spring to automatically discover and delete beans. i.e. beans in the Spring application can now be declared and wired without any <bean> tag.

<context:component-scan> does everthing that <context:annotation-config> does, in addition, to auto-scanning.

when u use <context:component-scan> u don't use "<bean>" tag in spring bean configuration file, but u must mention

	@Component for each class , u want to treat it as a bean.

i.e.

@Component
public class Book{}

@Component
public class Author{}
