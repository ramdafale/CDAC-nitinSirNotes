	interface in java

interfaces are abstract in nature. i.e. they can not be instantiated.

interface can contain methods declaration. Method which is declared inside interface is by default "public" and "abstract".

variable which is declared in interface is by default "public","static" and "final".

a class can be derived from one or more interfaces. ("implements" keyword)

child class has to define all the methods of parent interface/s otherwise u need to make child class as "abstract".

one interface can be derived from one or more other interfaces. ("extends" keyword)

if a class is derived from some other class and some interfaces, "extends" keyword should precede "implements".
