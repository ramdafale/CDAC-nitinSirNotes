StringBuffer is faster than String.

StringBuffer is used when u need to do lots of modifications to your strings.

String is immutable

StringBuffer is mutable

String s1="hello";
s1+"hi";

s1 will not be modified, rather it will create a new string "hellohi".

thus increasing memory consumption proving the fact that string is immutable.

StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer("hello");

if we say sb.append("hi");

a new object is not created, rather existing object gets modified. thus reducing memory consumption.

String uses + operator to concate the strings

StringBuffer uses "concat" to do the same.

String + operator uses 
	StringBuffer internally
	call append
	again convert StringBuffer to String


Conclusion:

	It is always recommended to work with StringBuffer
		a) it is faster
		b) less memory consumption
