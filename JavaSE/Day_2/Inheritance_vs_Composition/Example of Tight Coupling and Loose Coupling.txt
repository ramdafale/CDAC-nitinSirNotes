BirdController class

	Penguin p=new Penguine();  // program to implementation
		p.move();

tight coupling




		Bird

		move()

Penguin		Robin		joy


BirdController

	Bird ref;  // program to interface

		can be assigned any of the above mentioned implementation of bird and polymorphically invoked "move()"

	tomorrow even if new bird is added e.g. "Crow" , no need to change "BirdController" class as long as it works with the base class "Bird". This is "Loose Coupling".
