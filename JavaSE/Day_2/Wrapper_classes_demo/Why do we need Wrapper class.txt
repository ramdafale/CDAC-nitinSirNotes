suppose we have a method in java

	void add(Object)

in which we want to store any primitive value, we can not pass primitive directly to Object as they are not compatible. e.g. Object class and int are not compatible.

solution here is to convert int to Integer (autoboxing) and pass Integer to "add" method. This is acceptable because Integer is a child class of Object.


Wrapper class is also used in following case

String str="125";

System.out.println(str); // output  125

str+=10;

System.out.println(str);  // output  12510  ( concatenation )

solution:
	int temp=Integer.parseInt(str);
	temp+=10;

	System.out.println(temp); // output   135
