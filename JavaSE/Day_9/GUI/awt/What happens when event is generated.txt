What happens when even is generated ?

1) event is generated
2) source identifies the type of event class 
		(e.g MouseEvent, ActionEvent, KeyEvent etc)
3) source instantiate event class
4) instance of event class has got the information regarding an event i.e. event id, source which has generated the event ,x and y co-ordinates etc.
5) now source calls event handler of the listener class , which has registered with it.
6) while calling event handler, source pass "event class instance" as an argument.
