1. Applets can be embedded in HTML pages and downloaded 
over the Internet whereas Applications have no special support in HTML for embedding or downloading.

2. Applets can only be executed inside a java compatible 
container, such as a browser or appletviewer whereas Applications are executed at command line by java.exe.

3. Applets execute under strict security limitations that 
disallow certain operations e.g. read/write files, socket communications etc. whereas Applications have no security restrictions.

4. Applets don’t have the main() method as in applications. 
Instead they operate on an entirely different mechanism where they are initialized by init(),started by start(),stopped by stop() or destroyed by destroy().
