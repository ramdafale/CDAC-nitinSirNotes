create a folder "d:\trial".

now create 2 folders "client" and "developer" inside "trial"

inside "developer" create 3 folders "src","bin" and "lib".

define following class and save inside "src" folder.



package mypack;
import java.io.*;
/**
This is the first class
@author Nitin 
@version 1.8
**/
public class MyClass1
{
	private int num;
	/**
	this method will accept a number and return its square.
	@return the square of number passed
	@param  k number to be passed
	@throws IOException if number passed is less than or equal to zero
	**/
	public int sqr(int k)throws IOException
	{
		if(k<=0)
		{
			throw new IOException("negative or zero not allowed");
		}
		return k*k;
	}

	/**
	this method will accept two numbers and return the result.
	@param a first number to be passed
	@param b first number to be passed
	@return 1 if first number is greater, -1 if vice-versa, 0 if both are same.
	**/
	public int compare(int a,int b)
	{
		if(a>b)
		{
			return 1;
		}
		else if(a<b)
		{
			return -1;
		}
		else
		{
			return 0;
		}
	}
	public class inner
	{
		public void dispin()
		{
		}
	}
}






now go to command prompt:

D:\trial\developer\src>javac -d ..\bin MyClass1.java

you will find that inside "bin" folder, u get "mypack" folder in which

MyClass1$inner.class and MyClass1.class.

now in order to create API


D:\trial\developer\src>javadoc -author -version -d ..\docs\api  MyClass1.java

go inside "developer" folder and check whether "docs\api" is created in which we have api created for "MyClass1.java"

right click on "docs" 
	send to zip folder
make sure "docs.zip" folder is created.



now in order to create jar file go to

D:\trial\developer\bin>jar cf myjar.jar mypack


make sure "myjar.jar" is created inside "bin" folder. cut it and past it inside "lib" folder.



copy "docs.zip" and "myjar.jar" in "client" folder. That is developer gives ".class" file and its documentation to the client.


now go to client side 

unzip "docs.zip"

create following application which can use the class created by developer.




import mypack.*;
import java.io.*;
public class App
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		MyClass1 m1=new MyClass1();
		try
		{
			System.out.println(m1.sqr(10));
		}
		catch(IOException ie)
		{
			ie.printStackTrace();
		}
		System.out.println(m1.compare(25,75));

		MyClass1.inner i=m1.new inner();
		i.dispin();
		System.out.println("Done");
	}
}

open new separate prompt and compile it.


D:\trial\client>javac App.java


you will get error

package mypack does not exists!

solution: u need to set the classpath of "myjar.jar"

D:\trial\client>set classpath=%classpath%;myjar.jar;

make sure now u can run App.java without any problem.
