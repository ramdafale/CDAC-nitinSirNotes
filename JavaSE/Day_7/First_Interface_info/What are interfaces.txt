		interface

interfaces are abstract in nature. i.e. they can not be instantiated.

interface can contain 
	members
	abstract methods
	default methods
	static methods

members declared in interface are by default "public","static" and "final".

methods declared ( and not defined) inside interface are by default "public" and "abstract".

a class can be derived from more than one interfaces.  (implements keyword is used here )

child class of an interface has to provide implementation of the method/s which are declared abstract in parent or else child class also has to be declared as "abstract".

default method/s (which are by default "public") may or may not be overridden by child class. ( if overridden, "public" modifier is compulsory)

static methods are like utility methods which can be invoked only on the interface in which they are defined.




Summary of Interfaces:


An interface declaration can contain method signatures, default methods, static methods and constant definitions. The only methods that have implementations are default and static methods.
A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
