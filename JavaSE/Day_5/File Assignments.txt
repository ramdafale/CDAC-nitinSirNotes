1) accept as many as numbers from user till he presses "0"  and write these numbers in a file. Now Open a file and read these numbers. ( Hint :- use Scanner class for input, FileOutputStream, DataOutputStream, FileInputStream , DataInputStream)


2) create a customer class with following attributes
	custid
	custname
	address
	age
create one instance of it and store it in a file. (Serialization).
now open a file, read the object and read its contents . (Deserialization)

3) write a file copy program using byte streams.
( FileOutputStream and FileInputStream )

4) Write a file copy program using unicode character streams.
( FileWriter and FileReader )

5) using RandomAccessFile class create a file.
accept a message from user and write in a file.
now read the message which u have stored in a file.
now again accept a message and write in a file at the end of existing message.
now read the entire content of file . ( u should be able to read both the messages now)

6) create a class "Car" with some members. ( do not implement "Serializable" for "Car")
Derive a class "Nano" from it. have some members in "Nano" also. (implement "Serializable")
instantiate "Nano" and store this instance in a file. (Serialization).
read the file and read the object of "Nano" .		(Deserialiation) . 
Observe what happens when u serialize a child class.
is it persist ur parent class also ? 

7) modify above program so that "Car" members also will be persisted when u serialize "Nano".

8) accept 10 characters from a user ( use Scanner).
store these 10 characters in a file. (FileWriter)
Now open a file and read all these characters.
